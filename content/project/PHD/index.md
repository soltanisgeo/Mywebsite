About the figure: left panel- up: an extensive ambient noise measurements in Tehran (more than 800 points). down: results for H/V, exracting earthquake coda and the results of inversion process to retrive 1-D velocity structure (3-D velocity structure are not represented here (paper is not published yet)
right panel- up: extracting basin layers with rotation, meshing and a preliminary results of numerical simulation with Efispec3d.
